Client Meeting Notes 1 

Date: 27 March, 2025 

Mission & Focus 

Creative Climate is committed to more than just reducing carbon emissions—it seeks to drive systemic cultural change - success as a “shift away from an extractive mindset” in the arts and culture sector to support long-term sustainability. The organisation uses the term 'sector' rather than 'industry' to reflect its nonprofit and inclusive nature. 

Key Funder and Stakeholder 

Creative Australia 

What the Client is Currently Working On (Year 1) 

Creative Climate is in its startup phase.  
- Building organizational systems and governance  
- Engaging stakeholders across the sector - management of current and external stakeholders and need to get consensus on decisions to move forward 
 - Organising and attending national gatherings (e.g., Darwin, Gold Coast) 
 - Preparing to launch a new website by June

fit-for-purpose evaluation framework: “One that integrates the ambitions outlined in the Theory of Change and the requirements of Creative Australia, in a format that reflects the contributions and values of consortium members—and is also easy to use.”  

Future Plans (Years 2–10) 

Over the next four years, Creative Climate aims to: 
 - Increase number of programs 
 - Identify and fill resource/tool gaps 
 - Advocate for sector preparedness (e.g., mandatory carbon reporting)

 - Reduced reliance on carbon-heavy practices 
 - Integration of First Nations principles such as Care for Country 

Unique Role in the Sector 

Creative Climate is the only organization in Australia focused exclusively on the intersection of climate action and cultural transformation in the arts. It distinguishes itself from other peak bodies by combining cultural methodologies with climate advocacy, drawing inspiration from international peers like Julie’s Bicycle (UK) and Climate Culture Scotland. 

Evaluation Success Criteria 

Success is defined as: 
 - An evaluation framework that is closely related to theory of change but easy to use  
 - Framework serving as a fundraising tool 
 - Positive feedback from consortium members 
 - Evidence of sector engagement and practice change of extractive culture 
  
The focus is on cultural and behavioural transformation rather than traditional cost-benefit analysis.3

Current internal data is limited: 
 - 315 newsletter signups –potential survey candidates 
 - Some financials and projections available 
 - Website metrics not yet available (site launches post-project) 
  
External data (e.g., audience surveys) will be key to building the impact story. 

Project Scope & Clarifications 

Your team is expected to: 
 - Develop an impact evaluation framework 
 - Provide a high-level implementation plan 
 - Attend the April 10 workshop (primarily to observe)

AI Summary and Details of the Meeting 

 

Creative Climate Project Strategy Discussion 

Dora and Angharadwynne-Jones discussed the Creative Climate project, which aims to leverage members' expertise to advise artists and related bodies on sustainable practices. They clarified that the project's focus is on systemic change towards sustainable practices, not just reducing carbon emissions.   

Green Music Australia's Digital Initiatives 

Angarad discussed the lead organization, Green Music Australia, and its role in the consortium. She mentioned the project, Amadisi, a digital platform for carbon management and reduction, which has been trialed with five music venues and is set to be rolled out across the arts and culture sector. She also introduced the Centre for Reworlding, a First Nations-led organization, and their digital project, Billye, an online relational map connecting artists and organizations working in climate response and adaptation. Lastly, she mentioned the organization Climate for Art, which focuses on divestment and community building activities, and the performance company pvi collective, based in Perth, which creates socially engaged performance art works. 

Project Success, Risks, and Evaluation 

Dora and Angharadwynne-Jones discussed the project's success and risks, with Angharadwynne-Jones mentioning the need for a mentor from Dallas Group to provide feedback and help frame ideas. They also discussed the importance of aligning with Creative Australia's KPIs and the need to create an evaluation framework that is fit for purpose. Angharadwynne-Jones emphasized the need to capture the value of all activities and to identify key stakeholders. Andy clarified the definition of 'fit for purpose' and raised concerns about potential changes to the theory of change during the project scope. Angharadwynne-Jones suggested that if there were no appetite for the theory of change from Creative Australia, they would still value it for other stakeholders and provide KPIs as per their business plan. 

Creative Climate Partnerships and Governance 

In the meeting, Ian Heng inquired about the relationship between Creative Climate and its partners, to which Angharad Wynne-Jones clarified that it's a consortium with Green Music Australia as the lead organization. They discussed the governance structure and the challenges they're facing in startup mode. Dora then presented the project timeline, which includes research, analysis, and strategy stages. They also discussed the initial issue tree and the key lines of inquiry. Angharad Wynne-Jones shared the vision for the organization's future, including the focus on fundraising and stakeholder engagement in the first year, and the plans for sector engagement and website launch in the subsequent years. 

Climate Adaptation in Arts Sector 

Angaradwynne-Jones discussed the organization's plans to increase programs, identify gaps in tools and resources, and advocate for mandatory carbon reporting. She also mentioned the potential for systemic shifts in the sector's response to climate change, such as changes in content and development. The organization aims to support the sector in adapting to these changes and advocating for a shift in culture. Angaradwynne-Jones also highlighted the organization's unique role in the industry, focusing on climate adaptation and systemic transformation in the arts sector. She emphasized the organization's value proposition to stakeholders, which is still in draft form. 

Sustainable World for Next Generation 

Angarad discussed the importance of creating a sustainable world for the next generation and the need to prove to governments the appetite for change among citizens. She highlighted the need to support the sector and the public, with a focus on systemic change. Angarad also mentioned the challenges of gathering data, especially from the public, and suggested that external data could be a focus for the group. Andy asked about appropriate metrics to measure impact, and Angarad suggested focusing on the number of  organizations within the arts and culture sector that have engaged with them. 

Client Meeting Follow-Up and Next Steps
