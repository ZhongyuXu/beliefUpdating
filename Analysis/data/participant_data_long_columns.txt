General notes
- HSI refer to hidden-state inference (urn choice) task; FF refer to future-forecasting (ball colour) task.
- Letters A–D refer to hidden urn options; B, W, P, G refer to ball colours (Black, White, Purple, Green).
- Suffix `_r` = participant-reported percentage after the current draw; `_c` = benchmark Bayesian posterior from `obj_posteriors.json`; `_s` = step-wise model projection given the participant’s earlier report'; _t = ground truth (100 for chosen urn, 0 otherwise).
- Percentages use 0–100 scale unless noted.

Participant belief reports – hidden-state inference
- uA_r, uB_r, uC_r, uD_r: Participant-reported probabilities (0–100%) that the hidden urn is A, B, C, or D after the current draw. Columns are blank where the instance used fewer urn options.

Participant belief reports – future forecasting
- cB_r, cW_r, cP_r, cG_r: Participant-reported probabilities (0–100%) that the next ball drawn will be Black, White, Purple, Green after the current draw. Blank when a colour was unavailable in the instance.

Instance structure

Benchmark Bayesian posteriors
- uA_c, uB_c, uC_c, uD_c: Normative Bayesian posteriors (0–100%) for urn A–D after this draw 
- cB_c, cW_c, cP_c, cG_c: Normative Bayesian predictions (0–100%) for the next draw being Black, White, Purple, Green

Step-wise (Bayesian) posteriors
- uA_s, uB_s, uC_s, uD_s: Posterior percentages which re-computes Bayes’ rule using the participant’s last reported urn posterior as prior (or a uniform prior on the first draw) 
- cB_s, cW_s, cP_s, cG_s: Weighted average percentages which re-computes weighted average probaility and Bayes’ rule using the participant’s last reported urn posterior as prior (or a uniform prior on the first draw)  

Bayesian priors used in comparisons
- prior_uA, prior_uB, prior_uC, prior_uD: Prior urn probabilities applied for this ball draw. (uniform on the first draw; equals to the previous draw’s Bayesian benchmark posteriors thereafter)
- prior_cB, prior_cW, prior_cP, prior_cG: Prior colour probabilities—derived from urn compositions on the first draw or previous benchmark posteriors thereafter 

Absolute deviations

Decision-quality scores
- DQ_U_o, DQ_C_o: Overall decision quality = 1 − JSD_U_rc (urn) or 1 − JSD_C_rc (colour), so higher is better relative to the benchmark 
- DQ_U_s, DQ_C_s: Step-wise decision quality = 1 − JSD_U_rs (urn) or 1 − JSD_C_rs (colour), assessing consistency with the model-implied update 

Complexity measures – per draw
- EWCC_u, EWCC_c: “Equal-Weight Computational Complexity” for urn and colour tasks, treating multiplication/division and addition/subtraction equally
- MDCC_u, MDCC_c: "Multiplication and Division Computational Complexity" that isolate the multiplication/division component for urn and colour tasks
- CC_u, CC_c: "Main Computational Complexity Metric" used. Weighted Computational Complexity that count multiplication/division as two basic operations and addition/subtraction as one 

Complexity measures – accumulated within an instance
- ACC_u, ACC_c: Accumulated `CC_*` complexity up to the current draw 
- AEWCC_u, AEWCC_c: Accumulated `EWCC_*` complexity up to the current draw
