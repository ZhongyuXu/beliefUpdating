1010,NA,Hassan Andrabi,25,Male,Yes,Yes,Sometimes,I tried to use whole numbers for probabilities. I tried to remember the probabilities between rounds, and quickly enter them in at the start of the next round. Then, based on the ball draw for that round, I updated my priors slightly. I calculated the 'next ball drawn' probabilities by initialising the probabilities based on the single most likely urn based on posterior estimates, and then adjusting up or down based on the posterior probabilities of the other urns.
