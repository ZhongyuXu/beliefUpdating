% Potential structure: Big problem in science/field / Narrower gap within / Yet narrower (remaining) gap / Our approach/results

\subsection{Open science practices statement}

In the following sections, we present the results of a computational study followed by the results of a laboratory experiment. The code and data for the model simulations can be accessed here: [INSERT GITHUB LINK]. Prior to collecting the behavioral data, we pre-registered the study on OSF. The pre-registration included the data collection protocol and the data analysis plan ([INSERT OSF LINK]). The behavioral data and analysis code of this data is publicly available at [INSERT GITHUB LINK].

\section*{Results} \label{sec:results}

% Potential structure: Logic 1 (e.g., raw data), Logic 2 (e.g., processed), etc.


\section*{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

% Potential structure: Results -> conclusion (we found / we filled gap), limitations in filling gap, limits in generalisation, contributions beyond, science is better now -> yeah!
